              I am a software engineer passionate about building applications that truly help users solve their problems. My expertise lies in developing innovative, user-focused solutions using technologies like the MERN stack. Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projects, from Fact checking AI-powered tools.
              <br />
              What excites me most is creating unique features in my projects and pushing the boundaries of technology to make a positive impact. I am particularly curious about the future of AI and its potential to transform lives. I aim to develop solutions that not only innovate but also contribute to society meaningfully.
              <br />
              I look forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals to deliver impactful projects that solve real-world challenges. For me, every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and make a difference.
